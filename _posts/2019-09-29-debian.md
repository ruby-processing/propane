### Distro ###

For ease of use you should install the latest version of [Linux Mint 19.2 Tina][mint], Cinnamon Edition is modern and clean. Otherwise you might find software versions hopelessly out of date, you can get round it but is is more work.  In general you want the non-free (as in closed source) graphics drivers for `opengl` performance (Mint will likely install them for you).

### Required Dependencies ###

#### Java ####

Unfortunately there is currently a linker problem with stock OpenJDK on linux so we are recommending installing [[Eclipse Temurin][adopt] version which is available as a deb package. But you have to add the repository to your setup as follows:-

```bash
wget -qO - https://[Eclipse Temurin][adopt].jfrog.io/[Eclipse Temurin][adopt]/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository --yes https://[Eclipse Temurin][adopt].jfrog.io/[Eclipse Temurin][adopt]/deb/

sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install openjdk-12-hotspot
```

Use debian `update-alternatives` tool to manage configuration for java:-
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java # to configure if required
sudo update-alternatives --config javac # to configure if required
sudo update-alternatives --config jruby
```

#### MRI Ruby

Install MRI ruby (should be at least ruby-2.4), if you are not using `rvm` or `rbenv`, then you should create a home in a local folder to store your gems eg `~/.gem/ruby/2.5.0` to store your gems:-

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gem/ruby/2.5.0
```

To get `gem` command to use this location set `GEM_HOME` and `GEM_PATH` in `~/.profile` and add the `GEM_PATH/bin` to `PATH` as below:-

```bash
export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.5.0"
export GEM_PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.5.0"
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin directories
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$GEM_PATH/bin:$PATH"
```

#### JRuby

Download and install latest jruby (in the `/opt` folder makes sense). See [JRuby downloads][downloads] for latest releases.

Use `update-alternatives` to install and maintain configuration eg for jruby:-
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jruby jruby /opt/jruby-9.2.14.0/bin/jruby 100
sudo update-alternatives --config jruby # to configure if required
```

### propane

```bash
jgem install propane # or `jruby -S gem`, use rvm at your own risk...
```

Install Samples

```bash
propane --install Samples
```

Install Sound library

```bash
propane --install Sound
```

Install Video library _the past but stable?_

```bash
propane --install Video
```

Install GLVideo library _the future but unstable_

```bash
propane --install glvideo
# experimental, expected to work on Raspberry-Pi debian-linux and MacOS
```

### Optional extra Atom ###

Even if you've been using vim/emacs it might be worth at least giving [atom][atom] a try, if you are coming from Windows you should probably install it!!! Vim/Emacs might come as bit of a shock.

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least1.44.0) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
```

### Running examples ###

To explore the installed examples:-
```bash
cd ~/propane_samples
rake # to run examples randomly as a demo
# or check available tasks with
rake --tasks
# use a task to randomly run a group of sketches eg
rake shaders # runs the shader examples
```

To create a simple sketch:-
```bash
propane -c fred 200 200 # sketch name=Fred width=200 height=200 mode=default
propane -c my_sketch 300 300 p2d # sketch name=MySketch width=300 height=300 mode=P2D
```
Edit `fred.rb` or `my_sketch.rb` with your favourite editor preferably `vim`, `emacs` or `atom`.

To run sketch using the command line

```bash
jruby fred.rb
```

To run a sketch from editor see [editors][editors]
