### Getting Started With propane

If you love to code because it is a creative process, then you should give propane a try because it can be used to create [music][sound], art, animations, [videos][video] and much more. Also since it is based on the latest [Processing][processing] you can access a vast range of libraries to make the difficult things easier.

### Why propane?

You can dabble with the latest `processing framework` (in ruby) without even needing to install `vanilla processing` (and its embded jdk).

Additionally, you don't have to declare types, voids, or understand the differences between floats and ints to get started, as you do in pure Processing.

Although there are some drawbacks to using the Ruby version Processing (slower start up time, and sometimes performance), having Ruby's API available to translate your ideas into sketches more than makes up for them.

#### Java ####

The current state of stock OpenJDK is not good (linker problems etc) and being non-free OracleJDK is unsupported so we currently recommending installing [AdoptOpenJDK][adopt] fortunately there is a [homebrew][brew] script for this. You also need [wget][wget] to download samples and libraries, but there is [homebrew][brew] script for this as well.

```bash
brew install wget
brew cask install adoptopenjdk
```

#### JRuby ####

Like `JRubyArt` you do not need `rvm` or `rbenv` to install `jruby` because we expect you to run `propane` sketches using the `jruby` command but unlike `JRubyArt` you must install `jruby`, preferably `jruby-9.2.13.0+`. In fact you should use `jgem` or `jruby -S gem` to install `propane` and some other gems. See also [JRuby downloads][downloads] for latest releases.

```bash
brew install jruby # installs latest jruby
```

#### propane ####

```bash
jgem install propane # or `jruby -S gem`, use rvm at your own risk...
```

Install Samples

```bash
propane --install Samples
```

Install Sound library

```bash
propane --install Sound
```

Install Video library _the past but stable?_

```bash
propane --install Video
```

### Running examples

To run a bunch of the samples as a demo:-

```bash
cd ~/propane_samples
rake # autoruns a bunch of files as a demo
cd ~/propane_samples/contributed # for example
rake # autoruns files in contributed folder
jruby jwishy.rb # run the JWishy sketch, using an installed jruby
cd ~/propane_samples/processing_app/topics/shaders
rake # autoruns shader sketches
jruby monjori.rb # run single shader sketch, since propane-1.0
```

### Creating your own sketch

All we ask is that you obey the ruby filename convention (ie snakecase) and we can create a template sketch for you as follows:-

```bash
propane --create fred_sketch 200 200 # creates a propane sketch fred_sketch.rb (see below)
vim fred_sketch.rb
:!jruby % # from vim runs the sketch
```

other [editors][editors] are available

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true
require 'propane'

class FredSketch
  def setup
  sketch_title 'Fred Sketch'
  end

  def draw

  end

  def settings
  size 200, 200
  # smooth # here
  end
end

FredSketch.new
```

### Running examples ###

To explore the installed examples:-
```bash
cd ~/propane_samples
rake # to run examples randomly as a demo
# or check available tasks with
rake --tasks
# use a task to randomly run a group of sketches eg
rake shaders # runs the shader examples
```

To create a simple sketch:-
```bash
propane -c fred 200 200 # sketch name=Fred width=200 height=200 mode=default
propane -c my_sketch 300 300 p2d # sketch name=MySketch width=300 height=300 mode=P2D
```
Edit `fred.rb` or `my_sketch.rb` with your favourite editor preferably `vim`, `emacs` or `atom`.

To run sketch using the command line

```bash
jruby fred.rb
```

To run a sketch from editor see [editors][editors]
