### Distro ###

For ease of use you should install the latest version of [Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa][mint], Cinnamon Edition is modern and clean. Otherwise you might find software versions hopelessly out of date, you can get round it but is is more work.  In general you want the non-free (as in closed source) graphics drivers for `opengl` performance (Mint will likely install them for you).  You will likely want to customise your desktop to include a `gnome-terminal` launcher (it is much easier to do things from a terminal, eg `sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre` than struggle with the gui).

### Required Dependencies ###

Currently you should install the latest [jdk11 from Oracle][jdk] and use the excellent `update-alternatives` tool on debian to provide the symbolic links (and to manage which version is active). Debian seem to have made major cock-up in their openjdk releases.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk{version}/bin/java 100
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

Similarly you should unpack the [jruby tarball][jruby] to `/opt`  then use the excellent update alternative tool to provide symbolic links to `jruby`, `jgem`, `jirb` etc.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jruby jruby /opt/jruby{version}/bin/jruby 100
sudo update-alternatives --config jruby
```

If you absolutely must use `rvm` to install ruby/jruby personally I would avoid it like the plague (unless you are doing rails development it is complete overkill and an absolute pain). Unlike `JRubyArt` and `ruby-processing` it is not possible to run `propane` without a system install of jruby. It is highly recommended that you create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin/jruby`, it is the easiest way to ensure that `jruby` is on you `PATH` and you can then make sketches executable with `#!/usr/bin/env jruby` (and `chmod +x`). Further you will be able to run sketches from `atom` using the `script` plugin (without needing to start `atom` from the command-line to pick up environmental variables).

You should prefer to install gems locally (no need for sudo). To do that it is convenient on linux Mint to edit your `~/.profile` file as follows, the important thing is ensure that the gem bin directory is on your path.

```bash
alias jpry="jruby -e \"require 'pry'; binding.pry\""
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk11.0.2" # if using oracle java openjdk-11 is fine though
export GEM_HOME="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export GEM_PATH="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GEM_PATH}/bin"
```
Note editors with their own launcher may not respect this profile (see [script][script])

### propane

```bash
jgem install propane # or `jruby -S gem`, use rvm at your own risk...
```

Install Samples

```bash
propane --install Samples
```

Install Sound library

```bash
propane --install Sound
```

Install Video library _the past but stable?_

```bash
propane --install Video
```

Install GLVideo library _the future but unstable_

```bash
propane --install glvideo
# experimental, expected to work on Raspberry-Pi debian-linux and MacOS
```

### Optional extra Atom ###

Even if you've been using vim/emacs it might be worth at least giving [atom][atom] a try, if you are coming from Windows you should probably install it!!! Vim/Emacs might come as bit of a shock.

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least 1.19.3) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
```

### Running examples ###

To run a bunch of the samples as a demo:-

```bash
cd ~/propane_samples
rake # autoruns a bunch of files as a demo
cd ~/propane_samples/contributed # for example
rake # autoruns files in contributed folder
jruby jwishy.rb # run the JWishy sketch, using an installed jruby
cd ~/propane_samples/processing_app/topics/shaders
rake # autoruns shader sketches
jruby monjori.rb # run single shader sketch, since propane-1.0
```

### Creating your own sketch

All we ask is that you obey the ruby filename convention (ie snakecase) and we can create a template sketch for you as follows:-

```bash
propane --create fred_sketch 200 200 # creates a propane sketch fred_sketch.rb (see below)
vim fred_sketch.rb
:!jruby % # from vim runs the sketch
```

other [editors][editors] are available

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true
require 'propane'

class FredSketch
  def setup
  sketch_title 'Fred Sketch'
  end

  def draw

  end

  def settings
  size 200, 200
  # smooth # here
  end
end

FredSketch.new
```

PS: `propane -c fred` also works with a default size 0
