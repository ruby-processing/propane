### Install Atom ###

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least 1.40.0) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
sudo pacman -S atom # Archlinux currently installs 1.40.1
```

Mac/Windows users could just download direct (or homebrew on Mac)

### Install Package ###

From the atom editor install the `script` package by [Kyle Kelley (rgbkrk)][script]

### Running Sketches ###

_Important_

To pick up the local environment you should start atom from a terminal.


To explore propane samples open `~/propane_samples/regular` or `~/propane_samples/data_path` folder, select a file to view then from Packages/Script select `Run Script`
