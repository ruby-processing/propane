[propane][propane] is a ruby implementation of [processing][processing]. Create processing sketches in ruby using regular ruby-2.5 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them. You can use both rubygems and and regular processing libraries in your sketches. Run them with jruby.

In general where there is a choice of using a java (processing) method or a regular ruby method you should choose the ruby method (eg use `rand` in place of `random`). Further you should prefer to use `JRuby` classes `Vec2D` and `Vec3D` instead of processings `PVector` class. Processing has a number of convenience methods which are not needed in ruby (eg 'pow' use `**` in propane) and some static methods have not been implemented in propane. For the processing `map` method prefer `map1d` ([see example][map1d]) or use `p5map` if you must. Another thing to watch is `color` which is implemented differently in propane ([see example][color]).
