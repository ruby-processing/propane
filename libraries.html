It is possible to use vanilla <a href="https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/">processing libraries</a> with propane, but we also provide pure ruby libraries eg `boids`.  Most libraries can be loaded using the <a href="https://ruby-processing.github.io/propane/load_library">load_library</a> method, the exception being those that can be loaded as <a href="https://ruby-processing.github.io/propane/gems.html">gems</a>. It is also possible use the <a href="https://ruby-processing.github.io/propane/load_library">load_library</a> method to load local libraries for your sketches see <a href="https://github.com/ruby-processing/propane-examples/blob/master/contributed/raining.rb">raining.rb</a>, if you stick with propane library conventions. For more advanced sketches it is often a good idea to create your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29">libraries</a>.

{% for library in site.libraries %}
	<div class="library">
		<h2><a href="{{ library.url | prepend: site.github.url }}">{{ library.title }}</a></h2>
	</div>
{% endfor %}
